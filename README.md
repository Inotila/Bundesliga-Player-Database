# Top goal scorer prediction

For this project I have choosen data set: Football/Soccer | Bundesliga Player Database from  " https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/oles04/bundesliga-soccer-player ".

I will use this to predict the price of a football player based on their position.

## three algorithms for this problem:

### Linear Regression:
Which is suitable for predicting continuous values. It assumes that there is a linear relationship between the features and the target variable.  I have chosen as a baseline model to understand the linear relationships between the position of the player and the target variable the price of player.

### Random Forest Regressor:
Which is an ensemble method that combines multiple decision trees. And does a good job at handling non-linear relationships and interactions between features. This will is capture non-linear relationships and feature interactions.

### Gradient Boosting Regressor:
Which builds models sequentially to correct errors of previous models. It works well with a variety of datasets and provides good accuracy. And it has the ability to improve prediction accuracy through iterative learning.
