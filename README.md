# Top goal scorer prediction

For this project I have choosen data set: Football/Soccer | Bundesliga Player Database from  " https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/oles04/bundesliga-soccer-player ".

I will use this to predict the top goal scorer for the next season.

## three algorithms for this problem:

### Linear Regression:
Which is suitable for predicting continuous values. It assumes that there is a linear relationship between the features and the target variable.

### Random Forest Regressor:
Which is an ensemble method that combines multiple decision trees. And does a good job at handling non-linear relationships and interactions between features.

### Gradient Boosting Regressor:
Which builds models sequentially to correct errors of previous models.
